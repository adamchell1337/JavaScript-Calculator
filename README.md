# JavaScriptCalculator
## My Approach
My aim was to create a simple calculator application that uses JavaScript to perform the various operations.  I used HTML to create the visual aspects of the calculator, such as the display screen and buttons. I also made use of the ‘data-num=‘ attribute so that a value could be assigned to each html element/button. 
I used CSS to style the page, using flex properties to align the buttons and set the colours, including when they are hovered over and pressed. 
I used JavaScript to perform each calculation and made use of the eval() function to convert a string's value to JavaScript code to be executed.
